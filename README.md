# Stay Alive

[üá∫üá∏ EN | [üáßüá∑ PT](https://github.com/gabe-frasz/stay-alive/blob/main/_docs/README-PT.md)]

This repo contains the Senac's second integrative project and consists of an educational 2D game aimed at teaching high school subjects. The goal is to convey scientific concepts through the theme "forces of nature", integrating them into the game mechanics in an interactive and contextualized way.

The subjects covered include food chain, distillation, Fungi and Plantae kingdoms, ethnobotany, friction and combustion. The game adopts a survival style and is structured in phases, in which each challenge is directly related to one of these contents.

The narrative follows Linus, a high school student who, during his vacation on a cruise, ends up shipwrecked and stranded on an island. To survive the next five days until rescue, he needs to apply his knowledge of biology and natural sciences, facing challenges based on real situations.
